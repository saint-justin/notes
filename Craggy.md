Goals:
1. Hand-curated collection of climbing, sorted by crag, by area, or by route
2. Easy to navigate through different levels of detail
	1. State > Region > Crag > Wall > Route
3. Clear pictures of each wall visualizing each route
	1. Crag layout images should be interactive and intuitive
	2. Clicking/tapping a line brings up details about it, clicking again brings up a page for that content

Stretch Goals:
1. GPS directions to each locations (wearables?)
